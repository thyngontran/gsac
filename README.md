<code>
directory view:
. root folder
./img  all image resources file
./lib folder contains all the angularjs, angular material, aws cognito lib 
</code>

The index.hmtl is the starting point that includes main.js and .css and all other js libraries above.  Other *.html are html templates that use in the popup dialog.

Even JavaScript does not require compiling, we should have a build file (TODO) that include karma unit test, and end-to-end testings (e2e).   (TODO)
